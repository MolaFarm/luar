# Luar

Luar is a rust implementation of Lua, which includes a Lua interpreter and a Lua virtual machine provided in the form of a library, as well as a GC implemented in rust that is strongly coupled to this project.

This project was almost entirely completed under the instruction of the following blog
- interpreter & virtual machine : [build-lua-in-rust](https://wubingzheng.github.io/build-lua-in-rust/zh/PREFACE.html)
- GC : [implementing-a-safe-garbage-collector-in-rust](https://coredumped.dev/2022/04/11/implementing-a-safe-garbage-collector-in-rust)
